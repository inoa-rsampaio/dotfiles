# Contributing

We prefer [TBD](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) to preserve a linear history. So please, always rebase before MR.

The commit messages should follow the
[ Angular commit conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).
You might find useful to use the [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/) tool to enforce the correct format.

If your MR is linked to a card on [trello](https://trello.com/), we encourage you to add the link to the car on the
`longer description` field of your commit message.

 1. **Branch** over the `latest` branch
 2. **Commit** your changes to your own branch
 3. **Merge request** setting yourself as the responsible and choosing the appropriate reviewer
 4. **Discuss and change** the code so the reviewer can close the discussions
 5. **Clean up** the commits and squash them to a minimal and meaningful changeset
 7. Make sure the CHANGELOG was updated and the **version** bumped
 8. **Merge** into `latest`

NOTE: Please, keep your commits small and let the reviewer choose to squash them or not.
